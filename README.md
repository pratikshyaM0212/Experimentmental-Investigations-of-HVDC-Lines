# Experimentmental-Investigations-of-HVDC-Lines

Corona discharge, is a typical discharge phenomenon in an inhomogeneous electric field that occurs widely on the surface of overhead lines. Space charge accumulation
leads to pulse currents and influences corona loss from corona discharge. The analysis of the magnitude and distribution of space charges over the conductor surface
and their migration patterns during the discharge process is of great importance for DC corona discharge research. Therefore, this work investigates
discharge, with the finite element analysis method using software FEniCS, the Poissonâ€™s equation is solved to compute the field strength at a point in space, then the finite element method is used to solve the continuity equation for the current and to calculate the space charge, which in turn allows the analysis of corona losses in DC transmission lines.
